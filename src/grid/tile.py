TILE CLASS

Tile class is used to represent a tile in the 2d simulated
world. This will take care of anything from flags to textures to 
geometries attached to it. Please reference to this instead of the
direct geometry in other parts of code.

class Tile:
	
	def __init__(self):
		#constructor code here...
		
		pass # syntactic sugar for an empty token (simlpy do nothing but don't throw syntax error)
